# Introduction #

As my own follow-up to [this blog post](http://pragmaticstudio.com/blog/2005/3/18/ruby-learning-test-1-are-you-there-world) and also [here](https://lab.patmaddox.com/pat/rubysteps/tree/master/lessons/003_tdd_tiny_tests) I rather like the idea of logging new things I find out about Ruby in tests, so that's what I'm going to do.

Quite a few of these were picked up from [this blog](http://blog.arkency.com/2014/07/hidden-features-of-ruby-you-may-dont-know-about/).

Lastly, I'll be trying to improve YARD documentation skills along the way.
